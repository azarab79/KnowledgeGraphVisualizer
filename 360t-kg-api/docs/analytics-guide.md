# 360T Knowledge Graph - Analytics Guide

This guide summarizes the analytics features of the 360T Knowledge Graph.

## Overview

The system provides tools to analyze graph data, generate reports, visualize insights, validate data integrity, and monitor system health.

## Running Analytics

- Execute `npm run analyze-graph` to generate analytics reports (saved in `360t-kg-api/reports/`).
- Execute `npm run generate-dashboard` to create an interactive HTML dashboard (`360t-kg-api/dashboard/index.html`).

## Key Analytics

- **Module Statistics**: Counts, dependencies, complexity.
- **Test Coverage**: Coverage by module, untested components.
- **Product Usage**: Distribution, relationships, workflows.
- **UI Navigation**: Flow analysis, complexity.
- **Configuration Impact**: Dependencies, shared configs.

## Dashboard

- Visualizes modules, test coverage, relationships, dependencies, and product integration.
- Supports filtering, drill-down, export, and comparisons.

## Data Validation

- Run `npm run validate-data` to check data integrity.
- Reports highlight missing properties, orphaned nodes, invalid relationships, and consistency issues.

## System Monitoring

- Run `npm run monitor-system` to assess database, API, and system health.
- Generates health and performance reports.

## Custom Analytics

- Extend `scripts/analyzeGraph.js` with custom Cypher queries.
- Add new visualizations in `scripts/generateDashboard.js`.

## Best Practices

- Optimize queries with indexes and profiling.
- Schedule analytics during off-peak hours.
- Use incremental analytics for large datasets.
- Design dashboards for clarity, performance, and accessibility.

## Integration

- Export analytics data for external tools.
- Automate analytics runs via schedulers.
